# Echo

A Discord bot that provides captions for voice calls

Echo is designed to work on lower-end hardware, self-hostable and accessible.
Captions are generated using a local [Vosk](https://alphacephei.com/vosk/) model, ensuring privacy and low latency.
Transcribed text is sent to the text channel, a [web interface](https://github.com/SamDev-7/EchoWeb) is also available for real time captioning.

## Commands

`/join` - Join the voice channel you are in, caption generation starts right away

`/leave` - Leave the voice channel you are in
